# Introduction

`Neumorphism` is a new type of `Skeuomorphism`. It combines the realism with a modern look and feel to achieve a subtle soft pop-out effect on the html elements.

## Core Concept

Neumorphism is a powerful tool to use. It must however be used correctly. One of the core concept is to utilize similar colors for the component and the background.

To illustrate this, we will show a positive and negative example side by side.

<Space colored size={20} style={{ padding: 20 }}>
  <Button variant="shadow">Light</Button>
  <Theme color="#2c2f33">
    <Button variant="shadow">Dark</Button>
  </Theme>
</Space>

## Accessibility

One of the issues with `neumorphism` is that it can be difficult to see the element for people with low vision.

To illustrate this, we will compare it with a `flat` design side by side.

<Space colored style={{ padding: 20 }}>
  <Button variant="shadow">Neumorphism</Button>
  <Button variant="fill">Flat</Button>
</Space>

As you can see, it's easier to look at `flat` design since it is colorful but `neumorphism` has to keep to the similar color as the background, rendering it difficult to find.

## Mix and Match

In this UI Library package, most of the components have different `variant` to allow for flexibility in building your work. This will let you be able to mix and match as you deem fit.

Below are just some examples...

<Space
  colored
  direction="vertical"
  align="start"
  size={20}
  style={{ padding: 20 }}
>
  <Space size={20} style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Button variant="shadow">Neumorphism</Button>
    <Button variant="fill">Fill</Button>
    <Button variant="border">Border</Button>
  </Space>
  <Space size={20} style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Checkbox variant="shadow" label="Neumorphism" value="neumorphism" />
    <Checkbox variant="fill" label="Fill" value="fill" />
    <Checkbox variant="border" label="Border" value="border" />
  </Space>
  <Space size={20} style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Radio
      variant="shadow"
      label="Neumorphism"
      value="neumorphism"
      name="example1"
    />
    <Radio variant="fill" label="Fill" value="fill" name="example1" />
    <Radio variant="border" label="Border" value="border" name="example1" />
  </Space>
  <Space size={20} style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Tag variant="shadow">Electronics</Tag>
    <Tag variant="border">Border</Tag>
  </Space>
</Space>

## Theming

It is important to understand how `theming` works too. You can import `Theme` component from the package to make more colorful UIs.

There are a few variables that you can theme with.

- color (base-color)
- secondaryColor (secondary-color)
- distance (how stretched are the shadows in neumorphism)
- intensity (how much gradients produced based on the base-color)

<Theme color="#2c2f33" secondaryColor="#faad14">
  <Space colored style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Button variant="shadow">#2c2f33</Button>
    <Button variant="fill">#faad14</Button>
  </Space>
</Theme>
<Theme color="#0050b3" secondaryColor="#bae7ff">
  <Space colored style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Button variant="shadow">#0050b3</Button>
    <Button variant="fill">#bae7ff</Button>
  </Space>
</Theme>
<Theme color="#237804" secondaryColor="#d9f7be">
  <Space colored style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Button variant="shadow">#237804</Button>
    <Button variant="fill">#d9f7be</Button>
  </Space>
</Theme>
