# Introduction

`Neumorphism` is a new type of `Skeuomorphism`. It combines the realism with a modern look and feel to achieve a subtle soft pop-out effect on the html elements.

## How to use

In this UI Library package, there are two main themes, namely `light` and `dark`. Most of the elements has this argument in them. Below is an example of a Button

<Space size={20}>
  <Button variant="shadow">Light</Button>
  <Theme color="#2c2f33">
    <Button variant="shadow">Dark</Button>
  </Theme>
</Space>

As you can see, using them without the right background produces unpleasant results. It is advised to use the right background color like below.

<Space size={20} style={{ background: "#eee", padding: 20 }}>
  <Button variant="shadow">Neumorphism</Button>
  <Button variant="fill">Flat</Button>
  <Text>#eee</Text>
</Space>

<Space size={20} style={{ background: "#2c2f33", padding: 20 }}>
  <Theme color="#2c2f33">
    <Button variant="shadow">Neumorphism</Button>
    <Button variant="fill">Flat</Button>
    <Text style={{ color: "#eee" }}>#2c2f33</Text>
  </Theme>
</Space>

Neumorphism often has great visuals due to the subtle effects but also faces a problem with accessibility - i.e user find it hard to find the UI elements.

In the example above, we try to solve this by adding a `bordered` boolean to make the button more visible to users.
